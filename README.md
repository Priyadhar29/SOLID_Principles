# 💎 SOLID Principles in Java

> A practical guide demonstrating the five core **SOLID design principles** using real-world Java examples.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **SOLID Principles** are the foundation of writing clean, maintainable, and scalable Object-Oriented code.  
Each principle focuses on improving software design, reducing coupling, and making your codebase easier to understand and extend.

## 🧩 The Five SOLID Principles

| Principle | Full Form | Focus | Example Topic |
|------------|------------|--------|----------------|
| **S** | Single Responsibility Principle | One class = One job | E-commerce order management |
| **O** | Open/Closed Principle | Open for extension, closed for modification | Payment gateway system |
| **L** | Liskov Substitution Principle | Subtypes must be replaceable for base types | Vehicle inheritance |
| **I** | Interface Segregation Principle | Clients shouldn’t depend on unused methods | Smart device interfaces |
| **D** | Dependency Inversion Principle | Depend on abstractions, not on concretes | Notification service with dependency injection |


---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse  
- **Concepts:** OOP, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism  

---

## 🧠 Why SOLID Matters

- Encourages **clean architecture**
- Makes code **easy to maintain**
- Enables **scalability** and **reuse**
- Reduces **tight coupling**
- Improves **testing and debugging**

## 🌍 Real-World Mapping

| Principle | Real-World Analogy |
|------------|--------------------|
| **SRP** | Chef cooks, cashier handles payments — each role has one task |
| **OCP** | Adding new payment types without changing existing logic |
| **LSP** | Replacing petrol car with electric car — behavior remains valid |
| **ISP** | TV remote vs. Universal remote — each has only relevant buttons |
| **DIP** | Depending on a plug socket interface, not a specific device |
